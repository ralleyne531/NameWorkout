#### Interactive single page application, allowing a user to query (enter) their name retrieving the display of a system assigning a specific workout to every letter. 
#### I hope this helps those who want to shake up their regimen or get a quick workout in @ home!
<p>As a fitness enthusiast, and I've seen numerous social media posts that provide various workouts. On many occasions I would see an image of "workout alphabets", which to me looks like to a system assigning workouts to every letter of the alphabet </p>
<strong>Something like this</strong>
<img src="spellYourNameExample.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Sublime's custom image"/>
<p>Through this I was inspired to create a dynamic website that models this system and provides users with a random workout based on their first name<p>
<ul>
  <li>Currently, the workouts are fixed to each letter</li>
  <li>But, the rep amounts are randomized to one of the first 5 multiples of 5 : {5,10,15,20,25} </li>
  <li>Randomized rep amounts on every entry </li>
  <li>A "clear" button is availabe to make multiple workouts for yourself, or to help out a friend!</li>
</ul>
